<h2> MY MANTRA: IF YOU WORK HARD AND BE NICE TO PEOPLE, GOOD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.</h2>

<p> I started high school with a four year plan to become a teacher’s assistant by my senior year. It started with me teaching preschool at the child care center in my high school. At the same time, I was taking my first business class, where I learned that marketing plans were much more interesting to me than lesson plans. Although it was scary to abandon the life plan I had spent the last year crafting, I was drawn to the excitement of entering the world of business, and found an early interest in marketing. </p>

<p>Throughout high school, I continued taking business courses, took on leadership positions doing marketing for student organizations, attended career exploration programs, participated in a full time, week-long business simulation, and was heavily involved with the business organization, DECA, at the local and state level. I learned very quickly that I loved marketing. I was initially just intrigued by the psychology behind marketing concepts, but once I was hands on with the material, I realized that there was a future for me in the field.</p>

<p>I set off to attend Drexel University pursuing a marketing degree. I was accepted to the Pennoni Honors College and the accelerated BS/MBA program. I had no clue where the journey was going to take me, but I was excited to explore a new city and continue learning. Now that I am over half way through my junior year, I am grateful everyday that I ended up at Drexel, where I’ve had the chance to take classes in psychology, sociology, French, political science, and entrepreneurship- all of which have been essential to my personal development and have given me a new perspective on society and myself.</p>

<p>In my time at Drexel, I have had the chance to work on projects with students overseas, learning how to cope with time and cultural differences. I have explored finance, accounting, management information systems, and legal studies, among other topics. I have worked with managers to develop advertising strategy plans and thanks to my minor in interactive digital media, I’ve even crafted advertisements for a local restaurant. Beyond the classroom, I’ve done extensive event planning and handled large marketing initiatives for student organizations.</p>

<p>Post-graduation, I hope to enter the work force as a marketing associate who would be responsible for strategizing and designing original marketing content. Preferably, this would be with a consulting firm where I could expand my horizon to work with a variety of clients.</p>

<p>So far, I’ve discovered that I am a hiker, photographer, writer, marketer, web developer, graphic designer, painter, drawer, and professional. This website represent my personal and professional portfolios and experiences. Please feel free to find my contact information on my contact me page and reach out! </p>
